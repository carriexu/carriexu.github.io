    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog is powered by <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. There were a few issues I ran into while trying to deploy my blog to github pages, the first was the following:</p>

<pre><code>## Pushing generated _deploy website
To git@github.com:carriexu/carriexu.github.io.git
! [rejected]        master -&gt; master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:carriexu/carriexu.github.io.git'
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21356212/failed-to-deploy-to-github-pages-using-octopress">this stackoverflow post</a> I found, I learned that it was failing to deploy to github pages when I ran <code>rake deploy</code> because <code>git</code> was not able to recognize which branch to deploy.</p>

<p>To resolve this issue, I had to make a little change in the <code>:push</code> task in the Rakefile. I changed this line <code>Bundler.with_clean_env { system "git pull" }</code> to <code>Bundler.with_clean_env { system "git pull origin #{deploy_branch}" }</code></p>

<p>Once that is changed, I ran <code>rake deploy</code> again and it worked.</p>

<p>The second issue appeared after I tried to add a new landing page and moved my blogs to <code>/blog</code>, by following <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/">this tutorial</a>, I was able to add a new home tab and direct the initial landing to there, however, my newly added <code>/blog</code> page were no longer displaying the blog posts, instead it looked more like the blog archive page.</p>

<p>After digging around for a bit, I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24363061/redirected-octopress-blog-on-github-pages-shows-only-archives-link-instead-of-th">this stackoverflow post</a>, which was exactly my issue. To resolve it, I went into _config.yml, and changed <code>paginate_path: "posts/:num"</code> to <code>paginate_path: "blog/posts/:num"</code></p>

<p>This resolved the issue and my posts are once again displaying properly. Hurray!</p>
