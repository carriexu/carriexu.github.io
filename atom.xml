    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello friends, if you are reading this, I assume you are hoping for some guidance and tips on your job hunting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I am not the best person to give you any advice on this subject matter because I have just started to look for a job myself. Booo, I know.</p>

<p>Regardless, I want to write about a story. A story on how job hunting is the evil stepsister of dating. To be fair, they&rsquo;re both evil stepsisters. But without them, the world wouldn&rsquo;t know about Cinderella.</p>

<p>I digress, you see, the parallelism between job hunting and dating manifest itself in so many ways.</p>

<p>Job Fair - Speed Dating
Networking - Dating
Emails - Texts
Emails Selling Yourself/Emails Selling the Company - Sexts
Phone Interview - &ldquo;Just want to hear your voice&rdquo;
In-person Interview - First Date
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let you know soon&rdquo; - &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you&rdquo;
&ldquo;There are no openings at this time&rdquo; - &ldquo;Sorry I have a boyfriend already&rdquo;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like you to do a code challenge first&rdquo; - &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to google you first&rdquo;
&ldquo;We think you would be a great fit for the company&rdquo; - &ldquo;I love you please love me back&rdquo;
&ldquo;You are a great candidate but we are just looking for someone a little more senior at the moment&rdquo; - &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s me&rdquo;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d really love for you to join the company&rdquo; - &ldquo;I love you too&rdquo;</p>

<p>The job search is scary, just as scary as the dating world if not more. We want a job just as badly we want a life partner.</p>

<p>My friends, most of you are also looking for jobs right now, I encourage you to not be afraid. You can do this. Just take it one step at a time.</p>

<p>If you had just got out of a long term relationship, you&rsquo;d want to ease into the dating world because you haven&rsquo;t done this dating thing in a while and rushing into something else new generally isn&rsquo;t the best idea. Similarly, if you had just quit your soul-sucking corporate job and took 3 months to learn web development, you&rsquo;ll also want to ease into the job search. You haven&rsquo;t updated your resume in 5 years? Do that first. Get someone to read it and give you feedback. You are nervous about interviews? Prepare answers to commonly asked questions, the internet is your friend.</p>

<p>But most importantly, I want to adress this imposter syndrome I hear a lot about and also have myself. Repeat after me: &ldquo;I am a junior (whatever your asipred position is), I don&rsquo;t know everything, I will probably never know everything, and that&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Show your potential employers what you do know, what you were able to accomplish in a short amount of time, and what you hope to accomplish next. A good employer would the potential in you and take you under their wings. If you don&rsquo;t find one right away, don&rsquo;t fret, keep improving yourself, and learn something new everyday. It&rsquo;s great to look up to people who inspire you, but know that they started exactly where you are, a junior person.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been out searching for a while and no one has made you an offer yet, perhaps you could do one more project, learn one more skill they asked for but you don&rsquo;t have yet. If you haven&rsquo;t been out searching yet, like me, get out there! The job/person of your dream isn&rsquo;t going to fall into your lap anytime soon. The thought of potentially getting rejected because &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not good enough&rdquo; is scary, but you know what&rsquo;s scarier than that? Not getting the job of your dreams or meeting the person of your dreams because you were too scared to try. Failure is good, because that&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;ll really learn.</p>

<p>Bring it on, you big bad world, I&rsquo;m not scared anymore.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://larrybuch.com/index.html">Larry Buchanan</a> volunteered 3 hours of his time today and talked to us about design.</p>

<p>The <strong>design process</strong> is a complete mystery to someone who hasn&rsquo;t studied design before, namely me. Larry highlighted some key design principles and walked us through his design process using an example. Thank you Larry.</p>

<p>A few of my takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sketch first, code later. Thinking about design while coding is actually slower than if we sketched first and turn it into code later</p></li>
<li><p>Color</p>

<ul>
<li><p>RGB is for web and CMYK is for print. When using design software such as Adobe Illustrator and Indesign, always remember to switch to RGB when we want to deploy to the web</p></li>
<li><p>To start: use black, white, and one other color. Dark gray works well to bring uout the sophistication feel of the site as pure black tend to overwhelm</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Typography</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Serif and Sans Serif, try one of each to bring out contrast</p></li>
<li><p>Consistency builds street cred</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Layout</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make something dominant</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Grid system like Skeleton to help make sites responsive</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://carriexu.github.io/blog/2014/11/16/deploying-octopress-blog-to-github-pages</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog is powered by <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. There were a few issues I ran into while trying to deploy my blog to github pages, the first was the following:</p>

<pre><code>## Pushing generated _deploy website
To git@github.com:carriexu/carriexu.github.io.git
! [rejected]        master -&gt; master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:carriexu/carriexu.github.io.git'
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21356212/failed-to-deploy-to-github-pages-using-octopress">this stackoverflow post</a> I found, I learned that it was failing to deploy to github pages when I ran <code>rake deploy</code> because <code>git</code> was not able to recognize which branch to deploy.</p>

<p>To resolve this issue, I had to make a little change in the <code>:push</code> task in the Rakefile. I changed this line <code>Bundler.with_clean_env { system "git pull" }</code> to <code>Bundler.with_clean_env { system "git pull origin #{deploy_branch}" }</code></p>

<p>Once that is changed, I ran <code>rake deploy</code> again and it worked.</p>

<p>The second issue appeared after I tried to add a new landing page and moved my blogs to <code>/blog</code>, by following <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/">this tutorial</a>, I was able to add a new home tab and direct the initial landing to there, however, my newly added <code>/blog</code> page were no longer displaying the blog posts, instead it looked more like the blog archive page.</p>

<p>After digging around for a bit, I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24363061/redirected-octopress-blog-on-github-pages-shows-only-archives-link-instead-of-th">this stackoverflow post</a>, which was exactly my issue. To resolve it, I went into _config.yml, and changed <code>paginate_path: "posts/:num"</code> to <code>paginate_path: "blog/posts/:num"</code></p>

<p>This resolved the issue and my posts are once again displaying properly. Hurray!</p>
